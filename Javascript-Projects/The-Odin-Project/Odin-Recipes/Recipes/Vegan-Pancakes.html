    <h1>My Mother's Own Vegan Pancakes</h1>
    <p>This reminds me of my childhood in the hills of Mongolia and the planes 
        of Switzerland. I always had these vegan pancakes doused in gravy and
        hotsauce. Really reminds me of the time before cell phones, back when we all wrote with quills.
